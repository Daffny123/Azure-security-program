Public health and safety focus on protecting the well-being of people in communities. Public health is about preventing disease, promoting healthy lifestyles, and ensuring access to healthcare services. Safety involves protecting individuals from accidents, injuries, and dangers in their daily lives, whether in the home, workplace, or public spaces. Together, they work to create healthier, safer environments where people can live, work, and thrive. This includes efforts like disease control, emergency response, environmental protection, and public education.
